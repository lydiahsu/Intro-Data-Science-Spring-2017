  <p , style="color:black;"> Let's say we have eight cups of tea, and we'd like to do the following experiment to test your tea-tasting ability. 
    You are told that exactly four cups were made with tea poured in first, while the rest four were made with milk poured in first. 
  There are only milk and tea in each cup, and they look all the same. If you were to guess randomly for each cup whether milk or tea was poured into the cup first, what is the probability that you guessed them all correctly?</p>
  
<p> Solution: </p>
<p> Suppose you have eight slots for either, milk first or tea first.
Without loss of generality, I guess milk for the first slot, milk for the second slot, milk for the third slot, and finally milk for the fourth slot. The remaining four slots will all be tea.

The mathematical part:
(4/8) * (3/7) * (2/6) * (1/5)

Note that whatever combination I guess, for example, suppose I guess milk for the first, tea for the second, and milk for the third, tea for the fourth, etc: this will be mathematically the same as the one I did above.</p>
